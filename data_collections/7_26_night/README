This folder contains data collection taken on July 26 2017 on the LTA testbed

The data collection was taken in sets, each set with 4 trials.

The sets are:
- empty room 0 ambient lights off
- empty room 0 ambient lights on 

- object location 1 ambient lights off
- object location 1 ambient lights on

- empty room 1 ambient lights off
- empty room 1 ambient lights on

- object location 2 ambient lights off
- object location 2 ambient lights on

- empty room 2 ambient lights off
- empty room 2 ambient lights on

- object location 3 ambient lights off
- object location 3 ambient lights on

- empty room 3 ambient lights off
- empty room 3 ambient lights on

 All 3 objects are the same size but in different locations.

 In each object directory, there is a dims.txt file that contains all the room dimensions (sensor positions, height, object placement, etc) with that set.
