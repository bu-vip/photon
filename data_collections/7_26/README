This directory contains a data collection that occurred on July 26 2017 from 2-4pm on the LTA testbed

This data has the following setting:
- no fluorescent lights on
- sunlight coming through the windows

The data was collected in sets, each set contains 4 trials

Each trial has:
9 light sources listed in the first column
9 sensors listed in the fist row
Each time a light source turns on, we take 4 readings from each sensor
Each time a light source turns off, we take 4 readings from each sensor (labeled "bg")

The sets were taken in the following order:
- empty room 0

- object location 1
- empty room 1

- object location 2
- empty room 2

- object location 3
- empty room 3

NOTE: each trial has a filename with its timestamp. In general, trials were taken 1-4 mins apart and each trial occurs over the course of 70-75secs


 In each object directory, there is a dims.txt file that contains all the room dimensions (sensor positions, height, object placement, etc) with that set.
