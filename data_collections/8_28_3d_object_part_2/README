This folder contains a data collection taken on August 28, 2017 on the LTA testbed.

The purpose of this experiment was to take a 3d box with the same dimensions as the original black object and compare the localization accuracy of the two.

There are two objects:
- The 3d object
- The original flat black object

The sets were taken in the following order:
- empty room 0
- location 1
    * flat object
    * 3d object
- empty room 1
- location 2
    * flat object
    * 3d object
- empty room 2
- location 3
    * flat object
    * 3d object
