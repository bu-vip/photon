This folder contains data collection taken on August 4 2017 on the LTA testbed.

The data collection was taken in sets, each set with 4 trials. A set is contained in a single .txt file. (NOTE: all 4 trials are in a single file unlike previous data collection formats.

The purpose of this data collection was to determine the resolution of the testbed. This was done by using 6 different sized objects placed in 3 unique locations. 

The objects are named according to their relative sizes (not exactly multiples of each other, just a rough approximation):
1x
4x
8x
16x
32x
64x - the original object used in previous experiments

The sets were collected in the following order:

- empty room 0
- location 1
    * 64x
    * 32x
    * 16x
    * 8x
    * 4x
    * 1x
- empty room 1
- location 2
    * 64x
    * 32x
    * 16x
    * 8x
    * 4x
    * 1x
- empty room 2
- location 3
    * 64x
    * 32x
    * 16x
    * 8x
    * 4x
    * 1x
- empty room 3

Definitions
--------------
perturbation - turning a single light source on then off
trial - 1 perturbation per light source for a total of 9 perturbations. Each time a light source is turned on OR off, all 9 sensors collect 4 readings. There are 9 sensors *(4 on + 4 off) = 72 sensor readings per trial.
set - 4 consecutive trials
