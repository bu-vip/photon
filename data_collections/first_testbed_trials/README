This folder contains the first set of data collection on the LTA testbed

The data collection was taken in 8 sets, each set contains 4 trials.

The 8 sets are:
 - empty room, lights on
 - empty room, lights off
 
 - object1, lights on
 - object1, lights off

 - object 2, lights on
 - object 2, lights off

 - object 3, lights on
 - object 3, lights off

 All 3 objects are the same size but in different locations.

 In each object directory, there is a dims.txt file that contains all the room dimensions (sensor positions, height, object placement, etc) with that set.
